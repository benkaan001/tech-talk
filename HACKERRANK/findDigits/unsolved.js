/*
Given an integer n, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor.
Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.

EXAMPLE
n = 1012

1012 broken into four digits 1,0,1,2. 1012 is evenly divisibly by 1,1,and 2, but
not divisible by 0. Therefore return 3.

n = 111

111 is divisible by 1,1,1. Therefore return 3.

function findDigits(n) {}

console.log(findDigits(12)); // 2
console.log(findDigits(1012)); // 3
