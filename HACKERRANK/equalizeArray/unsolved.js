/*
Given an array of integers, determine the minimum number of elements
to delete to leave only elements of equal value.

EXAMPLE

arr = [1,2,2,3]

Delete the 2 elements 1 and 3 leaving arr=[3,3]. The minimum number of deletions is 2.

arr = [4,3,3,3,2,1]

Delete 4,2,1 leaving arr =[3,3,3]. The minimum deletion is 3.
