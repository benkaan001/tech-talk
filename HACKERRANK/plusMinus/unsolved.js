/*
Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements
that are positive, negative, and zero.
Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.

EXAMPLE
arr = [1,1,0,-1,-1]

There are n=5 elements, two positive, two negative, and one zero. Their ratios are
2/5, 2/5, and 1/5 --->
0.400000
0.400000
0.200000

  // Write your code here
}
