/*
Lily has created a new game where she determines the difference
between a number and its reverse.
For instance, given the number 12, its reverse is 21.
Their difference is 9.
The number 120 reversed is 21 , and their difference is 99.

beautifulDays has the following parameter(s):

int i: the starting day number
int j: the ending day number
int k: the divisor

EXAMPLE

i=20, j=23, k=6
days are = 20,21,22,23
reversed = 02,12,22,32
if |days - reversed| / 6 is a whole number, then it is
a beatutiful day.
Only day 20 and 22 result in whole numbers. Therefore
we return 2.

*/
function beautifulDays(i, j, k) {
  // Write your code here
}
console.log(beatifulDays(20, 23, 6));
