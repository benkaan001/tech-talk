/* 
The fibonacci sequence is perhaps one of the most famous algorithms,
and definitely one of the most tested during technical interviews.

Give a number N, return the index value of the Fibonacci sequence,
where the sequence is:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

The sequence is relatively simple mathematics. Each value is the sum
of the previous two values or:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
*/

const fibonacci = (num) => {};

console.log(fibonacci(5));
