/* For this activity, consider the original FizzBuzz challenge. This is FizzBuzz++.
If we take an input number, like 15, for example, 
all the natural numbers that are also multiples of 3 or 5 are 3, 5, 6, 9, 12. 
The sum of these numbers is 35.

Write a function that completes the solution  so that it returns 
the sum of all mulitples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in as a parameter.
However, if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5 (i.e. 15), 
you should only count it once in your final value. */

const fizzBuzzPlusPlus = (number) => {};

// Test cases
console.log(fizzBuzzPlusPlus(10)); // 23
console.log(fizzBuzzPlusPlus(15)); // 45
console.log(fizzBuzzPlusPlus(35)); // 258
console.log(fizzBuzzPlusPlus(500)); //57918
