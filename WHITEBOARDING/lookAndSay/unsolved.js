/*

Write code to create a function that accepts a number (`n`)
and returns a new number that satisfies the look-and-say-sequence
For example, if we were given the number `225332221`, we could break this number into the following groups:
1. 2 number 2s
2. 1 number 5
3. 2 number 3s
4. 3 number 2s
5. 1 number 1
We'd combine these to get the look-and-say-sequence: `2215233211`.
*/

const lookAndSay = (n) => {};

console.log(lookAndSay(544222)); // 152432
