var Company = function (companyName, revenue, isPublic) {
  // assign all of the parameters inside the constructor
  //to the values being passed when a new instance is created
  // --> create an empty array called 'employees' where we will store new employees that work at the company
  // --> create a method called 'addEmployee' that requires all the parameters
  //of the Employee constructor, creates a new employee by calling the Employee constructor,
  //and pushes that new object instance to the this.employees array
  // --> create a method that returns the number of employees currently working at the company

// export the Company constructor so we can require it in index.js
